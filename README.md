Hey, hope you're doing well! 

This is a simple implementation of data structures and algorithms in C and C++, I began implementing them in my first month of coding, check out my other repositories,
I will also implement them in python and maybe Java or Javascript in future.

##### What's inside?
- Implementations of all data structures and some algorithms, and also code examples of each one.

##### Why this repository?
- Learning: These implementations help me strenghten my knowledge and understanding of DSA.
- Future updates: I will also keep updating this in the future and add more algorithms, data structures, code examples, etc...
