#What is a binary tree?

> A binary tree is a hierarchical and non-linear data structure that uses 
nodes as their foundational unit of data. Each node in a binary tree
has at most two children nodes often reffered to as the left and right child 
nodes. The top-most node in a binary tree is called the root node, and the 
bottom-most nodes are called leaves, and they have no children.
